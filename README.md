Inventory/stuff management

# About
I have a lot of stuff, most of which is organized in a fairly neat way but I have no way of knowing where exactly that is or how much of something I have. Stocker is a generic inventory management program that'll let me quickly find information about a given item, or statistics about my collection of junk as a whole.
